[Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/JustRadical/jellyfin-rpc/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)

Program used to display what you're currently watching on discord.

Jellyfin-RPC uses the API to check what you're currently watching, this means that the program can be ran from a server or your computer. The only requirement is that discord is open and logged in.

## Install

For installation instructions refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/JustRadical/jellyfin-rpc/wiki/Installation)

## Setup

Just run it. If there's no config yet, Jellyfin-RPC walks you through an interactive
first-run setup — it asks for your Jellyfin URL, API key, and username, checks them
against your server before saving anything, and writes the config for you.

Run with `--configure` any time you want to redo that (new server, rotated API key,
whatever) without having to go find and delete the config file yourself.

For the full set of config options (blacklists, image display, custom Discord buttons,
etc.) that the interactive setup doesn't ask about, or if you're setting this up
non-interactively (no TTY, scripted deploy), copy [`example.json`](../example.json) to
your config path by hand and edit it — see the [Wiki](https://github.com/JustRadical/jellyfin-rpc/wiki/Setup)
(by the way, its an authentic emdash! i get paranoid about it so >:(  )
for what every field does.
